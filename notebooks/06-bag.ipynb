    "Bag: Parallel Lists for semi-structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask-bag excels in processing data that can be represented as a sequence of arbitrary inputs. We'll refer to this as \"messy\" data, because it can contain complex nested structures, missing fields, mixtures of data types, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Messy data is often encountered at the beginning of data processing pipelines when large volumes of raw data are first consumed. The initial set of data might be log files, or data stored in JSON, CSV, XML, or any other format that does not enforce strict structure and datatypes. For this reason, the initial data massaging and processing is often done with Python lists, dicts, and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These core data structures are optimized for general-purpose storage and processing. Adding streaming computation with iterators/generator expressions or libraries like itertools or toolz let us process large volumes in a small space. If we combine this with parallel processing then we can churn through a fair amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask Bag implements operations like `map`, `filter`, `groupby` and aggregations on collections of Python objects. It does this in parallel and in small memory using Python iterators.\n",

    "## An aside about dirty, unstructured data from web/REST APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The term `REST API` is used a lot to mean a number of things. REST means [Representational State Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Most people take REST to mean \"a web host that gives me data in JSON format\" (and JSON means [Javascript Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)). This technically isn't accurate, but you will often hear people use the terms `REST API` and `web API` interchangably.\n",
